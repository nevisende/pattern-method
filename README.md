# Pattern method
## It uses a "Recursive" method without looping which obeys the following rule based on the n value received from the user.

Rule : Subtracts 5 from the entered number up to where the entered number is 0 or negative. It prints the last value to the screen during each subtraction. Adds 5 again after the number is negative or 0. It also prints the last value of the number on the screen in each addition operation.
